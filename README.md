<h1>PDF SUMMARIZATION</h1><br />
<h2>Project Overview:</h2> <br />
The project focuses on summarizing the content of a PDF, any document based on the computational resources you might have. It automates the extraction of meaningful summaries using advanced language models and PDF processing libraries.
<h2>Libraries:</h2><br />
1. Py2PDF extract and preprocess the content from the PDF<br />
2. Gemma acting as a LLM and summarizing the text<br />
3. Streamlit for Deployment<br />
<h2>Workflow:</h2><br />
1. PDF Upload: Users upload any PDF file through the Streamlit interface.<br />
2. Text Extraction: Py2PDF extracts the text, parsing through sections, headings, and paragraphs to identify relevant content.<br />
3. Summarization: Gemma processes the extracted text, focusing on key sections discussing data-driven anomaly detection, and generates summaries of each section or the entire document.<br />
4. Results Display: The summarized content is displayed in the Streamlit app, offering a clear and concise overview of the PDF, allowing users to understand the document's essence quickly.<br />
