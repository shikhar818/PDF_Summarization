📄 PDF Summarization Project
📝 Project Overview
This project is designed to summarize the content of any PDF document, automatically extracting meaningful summaries using advanced language models and PDF processing libraries. It simplifies document comprehension by providing concise overviews, regardless of the document size or complexity.

🛠️ Libraries Used
Py2PDF: Extracts and preprocesses content from the PDF.
Gemma: A Language Learning Model (LLM) that summarizes the extracted text efficiently.
Streamlit: Used for deploying the application, providing a user-friendly interface.
🔄 Workflow
1. PDF Upload
Users can upload any PDF file through the Streamlit interface.
2. Text Extraction
Py2PDF extracts the text, parsing through sections, headings, and paragraphs, and prepares the content for summarization.
3. Summarization
Gemma processes the extracted content, identifying key sections and important details, and generates summaries for each part or the entire document.
4. Results Display
The summarized content is presented in a clean, easy-to-read format on the Streamlit app, allowing users to quickly grasp the document's essence.
